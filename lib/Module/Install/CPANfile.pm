=head1 NAME

Module::Install::CPANfile - Include cpanfile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # cpanfile
  requires 'Plack', 0.9;
  on test => sub {
      requires 'Test::Warn';
  };

  # Makefile.PL
  use Module::Install;
  cpanfile;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module::Install::CPANfile is a plugin for Module::Install to include
dependencies from L<cpanfile>.

Development requirement can only be checked if the developers has
installed L<Module::Install::AuthorRequires>.

=head1 WHY?

If you have read L<cpanfile> and L<cpanfile-faq> you might wonder why
this plugin is necessary, since I<cpanfile> is meant to be used by
Perl applications and not distributions.

Well, for a couple reasons.

=head2 Co-exist as a Github project and CPAN distribution

One particular use case is a script or web application that you
develop on github, and you start with writing dependencies in
I<cpanfile>. Other users or developers pull the code from git, use
L<carton> to bundle dependencies. So far, so good.

One day you decide to release the script or application to CPAN as a
CPAN distribtuion, and that means you have to duplicate I<cpanfile>
into I<Makefile.PL> or I<Build.PL>, and that's not DRY! This plugin
will allow you to have just one I<cpanfile> and reuse it from
I<Makefile.PL> for CPAN client use.

=head2 CPAN Meta Spec 2.0 support.

The other, kind of unfortunate reason is that as of this writing,
L<Module::Install> and L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> don't have a complete
support for expressing L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> version 2.0
vocabularies.

There are many of known issues that the metadata you specify with
L<Module::Install> are somehow discarded or down converted, and
eventually lost in I<MYMETA> files. The examples of those issues are
that test dependencies gets merged with build dependencies, and that
I<recommends> is not saved into MYMETA files.

This plugin lets you write prerequisites in I<cpanfile> which is more
powerful and has a complete support for L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> 2.0 and
makes your application forward compatible.
